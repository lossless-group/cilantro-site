## The missing context layer for real Code Assistant workloads.

Neo is a self-improving code reasoning engine with persistent semantic memory, using multi-agent reasoning to analyze code, generate solutions, and continuously improve through feedback loops.

Features:
- **Persistent Memory**: Learns from every solution attempt
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Vector search finds relevant patterns
- **Code-First Generation**: No diff parsing failures
- **Local Storage**: Privacy-first JSON storage in ~/.neo directory
- **Model-Agnostic**: Works with any LM provider
- **Available as a [Claude Code Plugin](#claude-code-plugin)**: Integrates seamlessly with Anthropic's Claude models and CLI.

## Use as a Claude Code plugin on the new marketplace:
