# Objective:
Generate a beautiful, creative landing page for our open source project, Neo. Build off of styling found in `src/layouts/sections/Hero--NeoRebuilt.astro`, but assume that is an amateur section layout.  We want something great.  

## The content of the page should shape the layout. 
The content is in the section below:

# Progress Comes with Struggles. 
### Vibe Coding or Context Engineering is powerful... but with significant limitations.

# Neo can get you out of The Matrix
Neo is the missing context layer for real Code Assistant workloads. It provides the missing context, team, and company knowledge to AI models, enabling them to generate more accurate, consistent, production-grade code.

# Do these frustrations ring any bells?  
### Why Vibe Coding can be frustrating and counterproductive

**Poor Contextual Awareness**: AI models excel at pattern recognition and syntax, but miss deeper project, team or company rules and patterns, leading to code that "looks right" but misses the real requirements. [^ucph8r] [^9f363s] [^17262x] [^8hy165]

**Limited Creativity and Design Thinking**: AI can't innovate or strategize; for open-ended tasks or complex algorithm design, its suggestions lack originality and critical insight. [^ucph8r] [^9f363s] [^8hy165]

**Handling Edge Cases**: Rare scenarios, multi-step error handling, and intricate algorithms often stump AI, resulting in incorrect or suboptimal code that requires manual correction. [^9f363s]

**Review Overload**: Apiiro's 2024 research found pull requests with AI code required 60% more review comments—especially on security issues—creating review fatigue and slowing delivery. [^vk4uhi]

**Productivity Paradox**: Contrary to claims, recent studies show experienced developers took about 19% longer to finish issues when using AI tools—the time lost to fixing, checking, or refactoring AI-generated code often outweighs purported efficiency gains. [^7rrgpy]

**Decreased Trust and Frustration**: Engineers reported frustration with superficial tests, hallucinated logic (code that "compiles but collapses in production"), and AI failing to respect proprietary conventions or nuanced requirements. [^17262x] [^8hy165] [^7rrgpy]
